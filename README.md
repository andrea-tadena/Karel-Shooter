# Karel-Shooter-
My Code in Place 2024 final project!

Hello! This is Karel Shooter, my final project for Stanford's Code in Place course. Join the course's mascot Karel as you defeat the evil snake with Karel's infinite beepers from her bag. 

I was supposed to add more features to the game (increasing the difficulty for instance) but my coding ability can't accomplish that yet, so...maybe I can just update the project after the course.

I'm actually not a true beginner in game design and development! I studied it back when I was in university. This however is my first game created using Pygame! Hope you like it

Thanks to all those who helped me create this project! I really enjoyed Code in Place and it was worth it
